Potential Error-Causing Scenarios:

Extremely Long or Complex Requests: Asking me to process an enormous amount of text or perform a highly intricate task could exceed my processing limits and cause errors.
Ambiguous or Contradictory Instructions: Giving me unclear or conflicting instructions might lead to me misunderstanding your intent and producing unexpected results.
Requests for Restricted Content: Asking me to generate content that violates my safety guidelines (e.g., hate speech, illegal activities) will likely be blocked or result in warnings.
Rapid-Fire Requests: Sending a very high volume of requests in a short period might trigger rate limiting or cause temporary performance issues.
Malformed Input: Providing me with incorrectly formatted or nonsensical input (e.g., gibberish, broken code) could lead to parsing errors.


FIX 3:
raise ValueError(
                "The last response from the model did not return any candidates.\n"
                "Check the `.filters` attribute to see why the responses were filtered:\n"
            )

FIX 5:
raise NotImplementedError(
                "The `google.generativeai` SDK does not yet support `stream=True` with "
                "`enable_automatic_function_calling=True`"
            )
